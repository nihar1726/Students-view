How this Laravel project works

User starts at Home Page (home.blade.php)

Shows a welcome message and one link: "View All Students".

That link goes to the students.record route, which calls the index() method in StudentController.

User clicks “View All Students” → All Students Page (students.php)

This page gets a $students variable from the controller.

Loops through all students in the database and displays them in a table.

Each row has a “View” link for that student.

User clicks “View” on a student → Single Student Page (student.php)

This page displays details for only that one student.

Data is sent by the show($id) method in StudentController.

Database

A students table is created via the migration.

The Student model represents that table.

The $fillable array in the model allows Laravel’s mass assignment for name and email.

Controller

home() → returns the home page.

index() → fetches all students from DB and sends them to students.php.

show($id) → fetches one student by their ID and sends to student.php.

redirectToHome() → redirects user to the home page.
